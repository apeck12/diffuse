Description of scripts (in order of use):
- generate_system.py: generate a dictionary with geometry and detector information from XDS files.
- Indexer.py: class for indexing diffraction images and processing intensities, as necessary
- index.py: wrapper for using Indexer class
- amend_system.py: revise system dictionary to include information relevant for map construction

- reference.py: tests of above scripts

TO DOs:
- check whether XDS 'A' matrix include orthogonalization matrix U -- note that U will be identity matrix 
for orthorhombic systems, so script should be fine for P212121, etc.
